## Introduction
This project explores more advanced concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python. It covers topics such as classes, instances, attributes, methods, properties, classmethods, staticmethods, data abstraction, data encapsulation, information hiding, and more.

## About
- **Author:** Guillaume
- **Weight:** 1
- **Project Start:** Jan 29, 2024, 6:00 AM
- **Project End:** Jan 30, 2024, 6:00 AM
- **Checker Release:** Jan 29, 2024, 12:00 PM
- **Auto Review:** Will be launched at the deadline

## Resources
- Object Oriented Programming (Read everything until the paragraph “Inheritance” (excluded))
- Object-Oriented Programming (Please be careful: in most of the following paragraphs, the author shows the way you should not use or write a class, in order to help you better understand some concepts and how everything works in Python 3. Make sure you read only the following paragraphs: “General Introduction,” “First-class Everything,” “A Minimal Class in Python,” “Attributes,” “Methods,” “The __init__ Method,” “Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding,” “__str__- and __repr__-Methods,” “Public- Protected- and Private Attributes,” & “Destructor”)
- Class and Instance Attributes
- classmethods and staticmethods
- Properties vs. Getters and Setters (Mainly the last part “Public instead of Private Attributes”)
- str vs repr

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

- Why Python programming is awesome
- What is OOP
- “first-class everything”
- What is a class
- What is an object and an instance
- What is the difference between a class and an object or instance
- What is an attribute
- What are and how to use public, protected, and private attributes
- What is self
- What is a method
- What is the special __init__ method and how to use it
- What is Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding
- What is a property
- What is the difference between an attribute and a property in Python
- What is the Pythonic way to write getters and setters in Python
- What are the special __str__ and __repr__ methods and how to use them
- What is the difference between __str__ and __repr__
- What is a class attribute
- What is the difference between an object attribute and a class attribute
- What is a class method
- What is a static method
- How to dynamically create arbitrary new attributes for existing instances of a class
- How to bind attributes to objects and classes
- What is and what does contain __dict__ of a class and of an instance of a class
- How does Python find the attributes of an object or class
- How to use the getattr function

## Requirements
- **Editors:** vi, vim, emacs
- **Interpreter:** python3 (version 3.8.5)
- **OS:** Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- **Files:** All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- **Line Endings:** All files should end with a new line
- **Shebang:** The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- **README.md:** A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- **Style:** Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
- **Executability:** All your files must be executable
- **File Length:** The length of your files will be tested using wc
