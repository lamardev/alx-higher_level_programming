# 0x07. Python - Test-driven development

## Description
This project focuses on implementing Python scripts using test-driven development (TDD) methodology. TDD emphasizes writing tests before writing code, ensuring that the code meets specified requirements and functions correctly. The project consists of several tasks, each requiring the implementation of Python functions along with corresponding unit tests.

### Concepts
The main concept explored in this project is:
- **Never forget a test**

## Background Context
This project introduces important guidelines for Python projects, emphasizing TDD principles and thorough testing. The following guidelines are highlighted:
- Documentation and tests should be written before coding to ensure comprehensive coverage.
- Intranet checks for Python projects will be delayed until after the first deadline to prioritize TDD and consideration of edge cases.
- Collaboration on test cases is encouraged to cover all possible scenarios effectively.

### Resources
To prepare for this project, consider reviewing the following resources:
- [doctest — Test interactive Python examples](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html)
- [doctest – Testing through documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html#what-about-exceptions)
- [Unit Tests in Python](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)
- [Unittest module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)
- [Interactive and Non-interactive tests](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html#what-about-exceptions)

## Learning Objectives
Upon completing this project, you should be able to:
- Explain the advantages of Python programming.
- Understand the concept of interactive testing.
- Recognize the importance of thorough testing.
- Write Docstrings to create effective tests.
- Generate documentation for modules and functions.
- Utilize basic option flags for test creation.
- Identify and handle edge cases effectively.

## Requirements
### Python Scripts
- Editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python3 (version 3.8.5)
- Files should end with a new line.
- The first line of each file should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory.
- Code should adhere to `pycodestyle` (version 2.8.*).
- All files must be executable.
- File length will be tested using `wc`.

### Python Test Cases
- Editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files should end with a new line.
- Test files should be located inside a folder named `tests`.
- Test files should have a `.txt` extension.
- Execute tests using the command: `python3 -m doctest ./tests/*`.
- All modules and functions must have documentation.
- Documentation must be a complete sentence explaining the purpose of the module, class, or method.
- Test files should cover all possible cases.
- The Checker will verify the presence and effectiveness of tests.

## Project Tasks
The project consists of several tasks, each involving the implementation of Python functions along with corresponding test cases. Below is a summary of the tasks:

1. **Integers Addition**
   - Write a function that adds two integers.

2. **Divide a Matrix**
   - Implement a function to divide all elements of a matrix by a specified number.

3. **Say My Name**
   - Create a function to print a person's name.

4. **Print Square**
   - Define a function to print a square using the '#' character.

5. **Text Indentation**
   - Implement a function to print text with new lines after specific characters.

6. **Max Integer - Unittest**
   - Write unittests for a function that finds the maximum integer in a list.
