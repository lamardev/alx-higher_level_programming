# 0x09. Python - Everything is object

## Description
This project explores the concept of objects in Python, including object mutability, immutability, references, assignments, aliases, and more.

## Background Context
Now that we understand that everything is an object and have a little bit of knowledge, let’s pause and look a little bit closer at how Python works with different types of objects.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

- **General**
  - Why Python programming is awesome
  - What is an object
  - What is the difference between a class and an object or instance
  - What is the difference between immutable object and mutable object
  - What is a reference
  - What is an assignment
  - What is an alias
  - How to know if two variables are identical
  - How to know if two variables are linked to the same object
  - How to display the variable identifier (which is the memory address in the CPython implementation)
  - What is mutable and immutable
  - What are the built-in mutable types
  - What are the built-in immutable types
  - How does Python pass variables to functions
